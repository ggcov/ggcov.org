    <b>Summary Window</b><br>
    Shows summaries of line, call and branch coverage statistics, as
    percentages, counts and colour coded bars.  Scope of summary can
    be chosen from: overall, filename, function, or a range of lines
    within a file.

    statistics.  The list can be sorted on any of the columns by
    clicking on the column title.  Double-clicking on a row pops
    up a new Source Window displaying the corresponding file.

    Shows function calls between any coveraged functions, and the number of
    times each call was made.  Combo boxes allow filtering on calling
    function or called function.

    <b>Call Butterfly Window</b><br>
    Shows, for a particular function, all the functions that call it
    and how many times they called it, and all the functions that it
    calls and how many times it called them.  Double-clicking on a
    function name in either list navigates the window to that function.
    Handles covered functions and external library functions
    (e.g. <span class="function">printf</span>) called directly from
    covered functions.

    Shows the graph of calls between functions graphically, with colour
