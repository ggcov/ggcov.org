<p>
<span class="program">Ggcov</span> is a GTK+ GUI for exploring test coverage
data produced by C programs compiled with
<a href="">gcc</a>
<a href="">-fprofile-arcs</a>
<a href="">-ftest-coverage</a>.
So it's basically a GUI replacement for the <span class="program">gcov</span>
program that comes with <span class="program">gcc</span>.
</p>

<p>
Apart from presenting graphically and interactively the same information
as <span class="program">gcov</span>, <span class="program">ggcov</span>
has one extra feature: <em>call graph analysis</em>.
<span class="program">Ggcov</span> calculates a call graph of all
function calls known at compile time (i.e. excluding calls
made through function pointers) and applies coverage data to this
call graph.  The result is that you can see how many times a
function was called from various other functions.
</p>

<p>
The downside of call graph analysis is that <span class="program">ggcov</span>
needs to read and pick apart object files to get the call data.  The
code exists and works for i386 platforms with ELF format executables
only.
</p>

<p>
<span class="program">Ggcov</span> is in a very early stage of development, but is already
somewhat useful.  It is known to work on ix86/Linux; other platforms
should work except that the call graph feature will not work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="program">Ggcov</span> is written on Mandrake Linux 7.1 on
i386 and requires the following, which should be available on any
modern Linux distro:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>libglade</i> library with GNOME support
  <li>GNOME <i>libgnomeui</i> library
  <li>GNOME <i>gtk+</i> library
</ul>

<p>
If you port <span class="program">ggcov</span> to a new platform, please
EMAILME(mail me) the patches (unified diff `format' preferred). I will
try to incorporate them into the next release.
</p>
