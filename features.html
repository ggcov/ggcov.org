<dl class="features">

<dt>Graphical</dt>
<dd>
<p>Presents coverage information as graphically as possible, using
<a href="summarywin.gif">bar graphs</a>,
<a href="sourcewin.gif">colour coding</a>, and a
<a href="callgraphwin.gif">call graph display</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Interactive</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Information is linked together, e.g. double-clicking on a row in the
<a href="filelistwin.gif">File List window</a> displays the source
for that file in a <a href="sourcewin.gif">Source window</a>.
Information in tabular form is sortable by any column, and all
columns can be selectively shown or hidden.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Arbitrary Subsets</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Coverage summaries for various subsets of the source (All the source,
a particular source file, a particular function, a range of lines
in a file) are only a few clicks away.  The summary is presented
in <a href="summarywin.gif">a window</a> with both textual and graphical
representation.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Multiple Directories</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Source files spread over multiple directories are handled.  The
<a href="filelistwin.gif">File List window</a> can display source
files either in a flat list or a tree.  Lists of source files
show filenames with minimum pathnames from the common ancestor
directory.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Suppress by Pre-processor Symbol</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <i>--suppress-ifdef WORD</i> flag can be used to suppress source lines
inside <i>#ifdef</i> or <i>#if</i> blocks which depend on particular
pre-processor symbols.  For example <i>--suppress-ifdef TEST,DEBUG</i>
will suppress source lines inside <i>#if DEBUG</i> or inside
<i>#ifdef TEST</i>.  Suppressed lines are not reported in summaries.
This feature is useful to avoid having test infrastructure or debugging
code spuriously reduce the reported coverage level.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Suppress by Comment</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <i>--suppress-comment WORD</i> flag can be used to suppress source
lines which contain the given word in a comment.  For example
<i>--suppress-comment nocover</i> suppresses any line containing
the comment <i>/* nocover */</i>.  Similarly the
<i>--suppress-comment-between STARTWORD,ENDWORD</i> flag suppresses
source lines between a line containing <i>STARTWORD</i> in a comment
and the next line containing <i>ENDWORD</i> in a comment.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Flexibility in Specifying Source</dt>
<dd>
Source files can be specified by any combination of:
<ul>
<li>Directory: all coveraged source files in the directory
    and sub-directories.
<li>Executable: all the coveraged source files used
    to build the object file and any shared libraries
    on which the executable depends.
<li>Object file: all the coveraged source files used
    to build the object file.
<li>Shared library: all the coveraged source files used
    to build the shared library.
<li>Source file: exactly the specified source file.
</ul>
<p>

<dl class="features">

<dt>C++ Function Names Demangled</dt>
<dd>
C++ function names are presented in readable demangled form.
<p>
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Non-local Control Transfer</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Handles non-local control transfers, e.g. C++ exceptions or C <i>longjmp</i>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>GNOME Integration</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A <i>.desktop</i> file is provided so that ggcov appears
in the GNOME menu structure.  New source files (or 
object files, or executables) can be dragged-n-dropped
onto <span class="program">ggcov</span> from Nautilus.
Configuration parameters are stored in
the <i>gconf</i> database.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Text Mode</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> comes with a text mode program
<span class="program">tggcov</span> which can be used to provide
coverage reports for individual source files or entire programs.
<span class="program">tggcov</span> is designed for non-interactive
use, e.g. as part of a build process or test suite.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>CI Support</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The text mode <span class="program">tggcov</span> program has an option to generate an XML report in
the format used by the <a href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/">Cobertura</a>
tool.  This makes it really easy to use in Continuous Integration servers such as
<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, with the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin">Cobertura Plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> also comes with a program
<a href="docs/0.10/en/git-history-coverage.1.html">git-history-coverage</a>
which correlates test
coverage data to git commits, printing a coverage summary which shows
how well tested recent code changes have been.  This is useful for
nightly builds and Continuous Integration systems such as Jenkins.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Call Graph Analysis</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Calculates a call graph of all function calls known at compile time
(i.e. excluding calls made through function pointers or C++ virtual
function tables) and applies coverage data to this call graph.  The
result is that you can <a href="callslistwin.gif">see</a> how many
times a function was called from various other functions.
The downside of call graph analysis is that <span class="program">ggcov</span>
needs to read and pick apart object files to get the call data.  The
code exists and works for i386 and x86-64 platforms with ELF format
executables only.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Static HTML Generator</dt>

<dd>
<p>
New in version 0.10 is ggcov-html, which generates static HTML
coverage reports.  It has many of the features of the GNOME
program, including annotated source with flow diagrams, and
works in any modern browser.
</p>
<p>
There's also an older server-side PHP app which has more
functionality but requires more setup (see
<a href="docs/0.10/en/HOWTO.web.html">HOWTO.web</a>)
</p>
</dd>

</dl>


<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> is known to work on x86-64/Linux
and i386/Linux; other platforms should work except for the call
graph feature.
