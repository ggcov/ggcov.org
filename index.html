<div id="column" class="column">

<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> is a GTK+ GUI for exploring test coverage
data produced by C and C++ programs compiled with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</a>
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.2/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#index-coverage-510">--coverage</a>.
So it's basically a GUI replacement for the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.2/gcc/Gcov.html#Gcov">gcov</a>
program that comes with <span class="program">gcc</span>.
Please note: <span class="program">ggcov</span> is not a frontend for
<span class="program">gcov</span>; instead it reads the same data
files directly and does various extra processing on them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> also has a web interface which provides a large fraction
of the functionality of the GTK+ GUI.  <a href="/example/">Try it out</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="program">ggcov</span> also has a commandline interface which is useful for nightly
builds and Continuous Integration servers.
