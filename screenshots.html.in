    <b>Summary Window</b><br>
    Shows summaries of line, call and branch coverage statistics, as
    percentages, counts and colour coded bars.  Scope of summary can
    be chosen from: overall, filename, function, or a range of lines
    within a file.

    statistics.  The list can be sorted on any of the columns by
    clicking on the column title.  Double-clicking on a row pops
    up a new Source Window displaying the corresponding file.

    times each call was made.  Combo boxes allow filtering on calling
    function or called function.

    <b>Call Butterfly Window</b><br>
    Shows, for a particular function, all the functions that call it
    and how many times they called it, and all the functions that it
    calls and how many times it called them.  Double-clicking on a
    function name in either list navigates the window to that function.
    Handles covered functions and external library functions
    (e.g. <span class="function">printf</span>) called directly from
    covered functions.
