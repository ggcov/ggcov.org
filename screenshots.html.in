    <b>Summary Window</b><br>
    Shows summaries of line, call and branch coverage statistics, as

    <b>File List Window</b><br>
    Shows all the source files, with line, call and branch coverage
    statistics.  Directories are shown as a tree, with summarised
    statistics.  The list can be sorted on any of the columns by
    clicking on the column title.  Double-clicking on a row pops
    up a new Source Window displaying the corresponding file.
