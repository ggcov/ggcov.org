<h2>Summary Window</h2>
<p>
Show summaries of line, call and branch coverage statistics, as
percentages, counts and colour coded bars.  Scope of summary can
be chosen from: overall, filename, function, or a range of lines
within a file.
</p>


<!-- filelistwin.gif -->
<h2>File List Window</h2>
<p>
Shows all the source files, with line, call and branch coverage
statistics.  Directories are optionally shown as a tree, with summarised
statistics.  The list can be sorted on any of the columns by
clicking on the column title.  Double-clicking on a row pops
up a new Source Window displaying the corresponding file.
</p>


<!-- funclistwin.gif -->
<h2>Function List Window</h2>
<p>
Shows all the covered functions, with line, call and branch coverage
statistics.  The list can be sorted on any of the columns by
clicking on the column title.  Double-clicking on a row pops
up a new Source Window displaying the corresponding function.
</p>


<!-- callslistwin.gif -->
<h2>Call List Window</h2>
<p>
Shows function calls between any coveraged functions, and the number of
times each call was made.  Combo boxes allow filtering on calling
function or called function." +
<b>Note:</b>This window depends in part on data scanned from object files,
which will not work on all platforms.
</p>


<!-- callgraphwin.gif -->
<h2>Call Butterfly Window</h2>
<p>
Shows, for a particular function, all the functions that call it
and how many times they called it, and all the functions that it
calls and how many times it called them.  Double-clicking on a
function name in either list navigates the window to that function.
Handles covered functions and external library functions
(e.g. <span class="function">printf</span>) called directly from
covered functions.
<b>Note:</b>This window depends on data scanned from object files,
which will not work on all platforms.
</p>


<!-- sourcewin.gif -->
<h2>Source Window</h2>
<p>
Shows a particular source file, with line numbers and execution
counts for each line.  Lines are colour coded:
<br>
<br><span style="color:#00c000">green</span> - executed at least once
<br><span style="color:#a0a000">yellow</span> - part of the line executed
<br><span style="color:#c00000">red</span> - never executed
<br><span style="color:#000080">blue</span> - suppressed
<br><span style="color:#000000">black</span> - no executable code
</p>


<!-- callgraph2win.gif -->
<h2>Call Graph Window</h2>
<p>
Shows the graph of calls between functions graphically, with colour
coding for each function and calls between functions.
<b>Note:</b>This window depends on data scanned from object files,
which will not work on all platforms.
<b>Note:</b> the graph layout code for this window is in an early stage of
development and may respond badly (looping or crashing) to some
data sets.
</p>


<!-- reportwin.gif -->
<h2>Report Window</h2>
<p>
Shows textual reports which give various interesting summaries of
coverage data.  These same reports are available in text mode
by using <i>tggcov --report</i>.
</p>


<!-- legowin.gif -->
<h2>Lego Diagram Window</h2>
<p>
Shows the proportions of covered vs uncovered code code for
projects with multiple files and directories.
